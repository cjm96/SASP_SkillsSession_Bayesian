# SASP_SkillsSession_Bayesian

# Christopher J. Moore

This resource was put together to accompany a 1~hour skills session titled "Introduction to Bayesian Methods". 

https://grd349.github.io/SkillzSessions/#calendar

The main document is the Jupyter notebook **Bayesian.ipynb**

(The session was held on 03/02/2020 and was aimed at PhDs and postdoc resesearchers in astronomy who already have some exposure to Bayesian ideas.)
